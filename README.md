Objective : Analysis of the current software market with data from the StackOverFlow 2018 survey, mainly referring to the market for new software engineer just graduating from school in the US. We will base our data mainly on seeking the necessary skill sets, average and net salary, gender focused analysis, and other soft skills necessary to succeed in the market. 

Steps:
We will first analyze our audience( the survey takers), the impact that different groups of survey takers makes will help us differentiate how age/experience affects our skill sets and necessity to improve to the next step in our career. We will also likely figure out how the market reacts to a new candidate for certain jobs for either a male and a female. We will follow up by analyzing how distributed our audience are distributed throughout the world. Perhaps seeing a rise in survey takers in India, with this information we can analyze specific problems developers from different parts of the world are going through. With a followup in analysis of type of employment(full time, part time, contractors) and different fields of workers(health, tech, retail.. etc).  One other point in audience analysis that we are particularly interested in is imposter syndrome; as we learn more of the industry, we feel like we know less about everything, but is that what's really happening? With analysis to audience's thoughts to imposter syndrome, hopefully we can help those not so confident in oneself and let them know that not knowing everything is fine.

Furthermore, the next thing we're most interested in is how and what we are expected as a software engineer. The analysis of skill sets will allow us to prepare and perhaps even help others decide what classes or skills are required to be given to students just entering the field. Perhaps even tools including IDEs and databases to pick up for a better opportunity of getting a job, maybe using a Linux based system will help out your job search. Language preference is also a strong point in our analysis, with an overabundance of programming languages available, what are the better options and what does the corporate side of things enjoy but we are unaware. 

Finally we analyse salary. Salary is one of if not the most important component for a job. No one likes to be low balled or underpaid, right? We will analyze our data with respect to different states in America and what our anticipated salary would be for each position of different levels. Or even figure out how salary increases as our years of experience increases and what else is expected from us deeper into our career.
